//! Protocol types for smolvm host-guest communication.
//!
//! This crate defines the wire protocol for vsock communication between
//! the smolvm host and the guest agent (smolvm-agent).
//!
//! # Protocol Overview
//!
//! Communication uses JSON-encoded messages over vsock. Each message is
//! prefixed with a 4-byte big-endian length header.
//!
//! ```text
//! +----------------+-------------------+
//! | Length (4 BE)  | JSON payload      |
//! +----------------+-------------------+
